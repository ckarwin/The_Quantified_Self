# The Quantified Self 
### Optimizing health by learning from the past

## Basic Overview <br />
The Quantified Self is a holistic health program that seeks to optimize personal well-being by continually aquiring data of the key trackers that contribute to one's overall health. Importantly, the data is perpertually analyzed using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in order to make recommendations by which the user's health will be optimized. These recommendations pertain directly to the daily choices that each individual makes. The central idea of this program is that it is not enough to simply track one's data; rather, self-improvement can only be obtained by learning from the past. 


## Interfacing with Apple Health Data <br />

The current version of the code is compatible with **Apple Health** and the app **Health Auto Export to CSV** (available [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-auto-export-to-csv/id1115567069)). In general, there are many different apps that one may use to track different quantities. These are all integrated via Apple Health into a single user interface that contains everything, i.e. one doesn't need to track the data over the numerous apps. The Health Auto Export app synces the data in real time with a user's iCloud Drive. Finaly, The Quantified Self then synces with one's health data through their iCloud drive, which is direclty accesible on there laptop and/or desktop. Note that since the program is ran from the user's computer, and interfaces entirely through Apple applications, the software does not introduce any increased risk to thier data privacy. In summary, the code easily synces with the user's health data, as they only need to specify the path to thier iCloud Drive.
