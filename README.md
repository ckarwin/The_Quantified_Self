# The Quantified Self 
Optimizing health by learning from the past

## Basic Overview <br />
The Quantified self is a holistic health program that seeks to optimize personal well-being by continually aquiring data of the key trackers that contribute to one's overall health. Importantly, the data is perpertually analyzed using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in order to make recommendations that will optimize the user's health. These recommendations pertain directly to the daily choices that each individual makes. The core of this program is that it is not enough to just track one's data; rather, self-improvement can only be obtained by learning from the past.
