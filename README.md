# The Quantified Self 
Optimizing health by learning from the past

## Basic Overview <br />
The Quantified self is a holistic health program that seeks to optimize personal well-being by aquiring data over time of the key trackers that contribute to one's overall health. Importantly, the data is continually analyzed using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in order to make recommendations that will optimize the user's health. These recommendations pertain directly to the daily choices that each individual makes. It is not enough to just track one's data; rather, self-improvement can only be obtained by learning from the past.
