# The Quantified Self 
Optimizing health by learning from the past

## Basic Overview <br />
The Quantified Self is a holistic health program that seeks to optimize personal well-being by continually aquiring data of the key trackers that contribute to one's overall health. Importantly, the data is perpertually analyzed using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in order to make recommendations by which the user's health will be optimized. These recommendations pertain directly to the daily choices that each individual makes. The central idea of this program is that it is not enough to simply track one's data; rather, self-improvement can only be obtained by learning from the past.
