# The Quantified Self 
Optimizing health by learning from the past

## Basic Overview <br />
The Quantified Self is a holistic health program that seeks to optimize personal well-being by continually aquiring data of the key trackers that contribute to one's overall health. Importantly, the data is perpertually analyzed using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in order to make recommendations by which the user's health will be optimized. These recommendations pertain directly to the daily choices that each individual makes. The central idea of this program is that it is not enough to simply track one's data; rather, self-improvement can only be obtained by learning from the past. 


## Interfacing with Apple Health Data <br />

The current version of the code is compatible with **Apple Health** and the app **Health Auto Export to CSV** (available [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-auto-export-to-csv/id1115567069)). In general, there are many different apps that one may use to track different quantities. These are all integrated via Apple Health into a single interface that succinctly summarizes all the tracked quantities. The Health Auto Export app then synces the data in real time with a user's iCloud Drive. A user's iCloud Drive is then accesible on there laptop and/or desktop, and code uses this to interface with one's health data.
